# Conduit Architecture

Reliable data workflow runtime in Go.
Jobs come in over HTTP, land in Postgres (durable), get fanned out through Kafka (transport), and are executed by a bounded worker pool.
Redis Redlock prevents duplicate execution when multiple instances run against the same topic.
Built-in handlers include `webhook` delivery and `sql.etl` pipelines for Postgres-backed ELT workflows.

## Job State Machine

```
  PENDING ──► RUNNING ──► COMPLETED  (terminal)
     ▲            │
     │            ├──► FAILED ──► PENDING  (retry loop)
     │            │
     └────────────┴──► DEAD  (terminal, reachable from any state)
```

`CanTransition` in `store/store.go` guards every `UpdateJob` call. Illegal
transitions return `ErrInvalidTransition` - no silent state corruption.

---

## Packages

### `cmd/server`
Main wiring. Stands up the HTTP server, Kafka consumer, and worker pool, then
blocks on SIGTERM/SIGINT. Implements `jobWorker` (the `worker.JobRunner` that
runs the circuit breaker / Redlock / execute chain) and `kafkaJobHandler` (the
consumer bridge that feeds the pool). Drains in-flight work before exit.

### `internal/etl`
Built-in SQL ELT task executor.
The `sql.etl` handler reads a pipeline spec from `task.payload`, validates target identifiers, rejects write-oriented extraction SQL, and executes `INSERT INTO target SELECT ...` against Postgres.
This turns the queue into a small data workflow runtime for operational analytics.

### `internal/api`
Five Gin job endpoints, registered in `RegisterRoutes`:

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `POST` | `/api/jobs` | Requires `task.name`; returns the assigned job ID. Optional `idempotency_key` and `scheduled_at`. |
| `GET`  | `/api/jobs` | Cursor-paginated list. Query params: `state` (PENDING / RUNNING / COMPLETED / FAILED / DEAD), `limit`, `cursor`. |
| `GET`  | `/api/jobs/by-idempotency-key/:key` | Look up the job a given idempotency key produced. |
| `GET`  | `/api/jobs/:id` | Reads directly from Postgres. |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/:id/cancel` | Transitions job to DEAD. |

Operational routes live on the root router in `cmd/server/main.go`, outside this group:

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `GET` | `/metrics` | Prometheus scrape endpoint. |
| `GET` | `/live` | Liveness - process is up, no dependency checks. |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Readiness - probes Postgres and the Redis nodes. |
| `GET` | `/health` | Combined health summary. |

Metrics middleware counts requests by method / path / status.

### `internal/service`
`JobService` is the glue between the HTTP layer and the store + Kafka. It writes
to Postgres first (that's the commit), then publishes to Kafka in a goroutine.
Kafka being down doesn't fail the caller.
The job sits PENDING until the reconciler claims it or a reconnected consumer picks it up.

### `internal/store`
`PostgresStore` with a pgx pool. The interesting bit is `ClaimNextJob`:
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` lets multiple instances poll without
stepping on each other - each grabs a distinct row or moves on immediately.
No queue manager needed.

### `internal/queue`
Thin Sarama wrapper. Exposes a `Publisher` interface so `JobService` doesn't
import the concrete type (easier to mock in tests). Consumer marks offsets only
after successful dispatch - at-least-once delivery.

### `internal/circuitbreaker`
Three-state FSM: Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed. `jobWorker` calls
`Allow()` before every execution. When the circuit is open it returns false
immediately rather than piling goroutines into a broken downstream. One probe
is allowed per `OpenTimeout` to test recovery.

### `internal/lock`
Redlock over 3 independent Redis nodes. Lock key is `job:exec:<id>`. Quorum
is 2/3; if we can't get it, another instance already has the job. Release is
a Lua script - checks the token atomically before deleting so a slow worker
can't steal an expired lock it no longer owns.

### `internal/retry`
Exponential backoff with proportional jitter. The cap is applied twice - once
before jitter, once after - so `MaxDelay` is actually a ceiling regardless of
the jitter factor. `ErrNoRetry` skips remaining attempts for permanent failures.

### `internal/scheduler`
Tick-based cron runner with a built-in 5-field parser. No external dependency.
It handles cron-style scheduled callbacks only.

### `internal/reconciler`
Adaptive Postgres-backed recovery loop.
It claims due PENDING jobs, submits them to the worker pool, and recovers expired RUNNING leases.
When the queue is idle, it backs off to a slower polling interval to reduce steady-state database load.

### `internal/metrics`
Prometheus counters and histograms registered at startup:

| Metric | Type |
|--------|------|
| `jobs_enqueued_total` | Counter |
| `jobs_started_total` | Counter |
| `jobs_completed_total` | Counter |
| `jobs_failed_total` | Counter |
| `jobs_cancelled_total` | Counter |
| `worker_in_flight` | Gauge |
| `job_duration_seconds` | Histogram |
| `http_requests_total` | CounterVec (method/path/status) |

### `internal/logger`
zerolog setup. `WithComponent` adds a `component` field so you can filter by
subsystem in any structured log aggregator without grep-ing free-form text.

### `pkg/models`
Shared types (`Job`, `Task`, `JobState`) and config structs. Everything that
crosses a package boundary lives here so import cycles stay impossible.

## Design Decisions Worth Explaining

### Why Postgres as source of truth, not Kafka?
Kafka topics have configurable retention. A job that sits PENDING for a week
might fall off the log. Postgres doesn't have that problem, and `FOR UPDATE
SKIP LOCKED` gives us work-stealing semantics for free. Kafka is just the fast
path for getting work to workers quickly.
If Kafka is down, the reconciler covers due jobs from Postgres.

### Why Redlock instead of a single Redis node?
A single-node lock has an obvious failure mode: the node goes down between
acquire and release, the TTL expires, and two workers execute the same job.
Redlock requires a quorum, so losing one node doesn't compromise the guarantee.
Three nodes is the minimum that makes that math work.

### Why a semaphore channel over `sync.WaitGroup` for the pool?
`WaitGroup` lets you wait for work to finish but doesn't bound how much work
starts. The channel acts as both a rate limiter (acquire before starting) and a
drain mechanism (close + wait). Panic recovery in the dispatch loop means one
bad job handler can't bring down the entire pool.

### Why no external cron dependency in the scheduler?
The 5-field parser is ~100 lines and covers every pattern we need. Adding a
library dependency for something this self-contained would be overkill, and
keeping it in-tree means we control the `Next()` behavior for tests.

## Running Locally

```bash
# Spin up everything (Kafka, 3× Redis, Postgres, Prometheus, Grafana, app):
docker compose up --build

# First run: apply the schema
docker exec -i conduit-postgres-1 psql -U conduit -d conduit < migrations/001_create_jobs.sql
```

Infrastructure only (run the server outside Docker):

```bash
docker compose up -d kafka redis redis-2 redis-3 postgres
